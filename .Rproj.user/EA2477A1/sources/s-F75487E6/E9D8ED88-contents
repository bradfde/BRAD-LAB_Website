I am a Great Pyrenees Mountain Dog. I am the most athletic Great Pyrenees you will ever meet. My breed usually sleeps 18 hours a day but I cam run with the best of them. I go on two walks a day, one 30-40 minute jog every night, and have park zoomies about once a week (weather permitting). Learn about the infamous Pyr Paw and some of my other quarks [here](https://www.pyradigmgreatpyrenees.com/pyr-facts).

My research has primarily focused on sport-related concussion and the effect on gait and postural control. I am also interested in the relationship between concussion and subsequent musculoskeletal injury, which is the underlying foundation for my interest in the human startle response. I was recently awarded a Thrasher Research Fund Early Career Award (on which Dr. Bradford serves as a research consultant) titled “A Multifaceted Assessment of Post-Concussion Adolescent Startle Response and Injury” that will examine the acoustic startle reflex in 1) adolesents currently diagnosed with a concussion, 2) adolescents with a concussion history, and 3) healthy controls.
